                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    My history with computers and coding is very limited. 
                    For most of my childhood, we owned a home computer - <br>
                    but it was used for my mom's work, 
                    so we weren't allowed to use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing I did always have an interest in though, 
                    was <b>videogames</b>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was 4 or 5, 
                    I always dreamed of creating my own one day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But being 5 years old, I had no idea coding even existed, 
                    so I focused more on the art side of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to college in 2006, 
                    and while still loving video games, 
                    my interest in art had waned, 
                    due to bad experiences with teachers in school over the years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I moved on to studying things like psychology, biology, and history.
                <p>
                    <b>This period of my life was my first introduction to coding.</b>
                </p>
                    Due to the myspace era of the internet, dabbling with basic html 
                    to add videos and backgrounds to my profile was a fun activity,
                    but I never took it anywhere outside of myspace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately for me I got really ill with, what later turned out to be,
                    Chron's disease in my final year of college and had to drop out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ended up solely focusing on my illness for a long time, 
                    until I decided to start drawing comics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Which ended up being my second experience with coding.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Styling websites to host my comics on was, again, a fun activity, but once again I never took it anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this time I also managed to start an ebay business focused around 
                    painting and selling miniatures (Warhammer, dungeons and dragons, etc)
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't exactly a high paying endevour, but it still managed to sustain me for many years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately for me i ended up getting even more ill in around 2014,
                    and ended up putting comics on hold to focus on my illness, and to focus more on ebay too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst getting treament for my Chron's, i started making videos
                    on youtube, and later, livestreaming on twitch. 
                </p>    
                <p>
                    <b>This was my third experience with coding.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Styling profiles, and editing code for 
                    streaming widgets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And once again, i never took it anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until the pandemic hit that is, and my ebay business was no longer
                    able to support me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Various pieces of worldwide politics since 2016,
                    mixed with the pandemic, all but officially spelt the end for my 10 year business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was time for something new, to better myself for a changing landscape, and coding
                    popped back into my head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having always been interested in computers and video games,
                    and how they all worked, <b>I decided to finally learn coding.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was quickly introduced to the <b>netmatters scion scheme,</b>
                    and I jumped at the chance to learn, which is where I'm at today. 
                </p>
