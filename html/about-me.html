                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My history with computers and coding is very limited, 
                    for most of my childhood, we owned a home computer, 
                    but it was used for my mom's work, 
                    so we weren't allowed to use it.
                </p>
                <p>One thing i did always have an interest in though, 
                    was videogames. Ever since i was 4 or 5, 
                    i always dreamed of creating my own one day, 
                    but not even knowing coding existed, 
                    i focused more on the art side of it.
                </p>
                <p>Fast forward to college in 2006, 
                    and while still loving video games, 
                    my interest in art had waned, 
                    due to bad experiences with teachers in school over the years.
                    So i moved on to studying things like psychology, biology, and history.
                    This period of my life was my first introduction to coding
                    due to the myspace era of the internet, dabbling with basic html 
                    to add videos and backgrounds to my profile was a fun activity,
                    but i never took it anywhere outside of myspace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately for me i got really ill with, what later turned out to be,
                    Chron's disease in my final year of college and had to drop out.
                    I ended up solely focusing on my illness for a long time, 
                    until i decided to start drawing comics, which ended up being my second experience with coding.
                    Styling websites to host my comics on was, again, a fun activity, but once again i never took it anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this time i also managed to start an ebay business focused around 
                    painting and selling miniatures (Warhammer, dungeons and dragons etc)
                    which, while not a high paying endevour, still managed to sustain me for many years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately for me i ended up getting even more ill in around 2014,
                    and ended up putting comics on hold to focus on my illness, and to focus more on ebay too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst getting treament for my Chron's, i started making videos
                    on youtube, and later, livestreaming on twitch. This was my third
                    experience with coding, styling profiles, and editing code for 
                    streaming widgets, and once again, i never took it anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until the pandemic hit that is, and my ebay business was no longer
                    able to support me (various pieces of worldwide politics since 2016,
                    mixed with the pandemic, all but officially spelt the end for my 10 year business)
                    and i began to think about other careers that i was interested in, and coding
                    popped back into my head. Having always been interested in computers and video games,
                    and how they all worked, i decided to finally learn coding. I was quickly 
                    introduced to the netmatters scion scheme, and i jumped at the chance to learn,
                    which is where we're at today.
